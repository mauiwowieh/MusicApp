# MusicApp
My Music App is a web application used for songs management. 
The application is written in one project (both frontend and backend). In order to start the application you have to have two terminals running:
- one for the frontend,
- the second for the backend.

You start the first terminal with the npm start command.
You start the second terminal with the dotnet watch run command.

The login data:
- username: senaida
- password: duran123

You can also register your own account. You can take whatever username you like, but there is validation for the password.
